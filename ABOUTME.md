<h1 align="center">Hi thereðŸ‘‹, I'm VÅ© HoÃ ng Nam! Just call me Nam</h1> 
<h2 align="center">A student of IT from Vietnam</h2>


 - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a student of *Information and Technology* at **The University of Transport in HCMC**
Hey, what are you searching for? Wanna know about me?

### **SOME THING ABOUT ME:**

My name is ***Vu Hoang Nam*** and my friends just call me **Nam**. I'm currently a **3rd-year IT student at UTH**. I may be a little hard to get to know at first, but after a while, I promise I'll be more friendly and open.    
*So, don't judge me too quickly!* 

I got into this field because I'm genuinely interested in exploring and tinkering with computer software. Ever since I was little, **I loved designing and editing videos** and getting familiar with post-production software on my laptop. Then, I started dabbling in another type of design, UI design, and **got interested in creating software that could help people**. That's how I started down the IT path.

I was accepted into **UTH's IT major in 2020 and was part of the K20 "SHAPE" high-quality training program**. Here, I learned all sorts of things about technology, programming, languages, operating systems, and many useful algorithms. But you know, "*sometimes we can't remember everything we've learned*" (LOL). Man... how can I possibly remember all of it, right? 

Nevertheless, ***I'm confident in my ability to research and learn on my own***. So, if you have any requests, feel free to ask me. I'll do my best to create what you need with what I know. If there's something I don't know yet, I'll research it to fulfill your request, okay?

When I have free time, I enjoy listening to music, watching anime, reading manga, or browsing the web for fun. These things really help me unwind after long hours of work. You could say I'm the kind of person who likes to stay at home and only go out with close friends. *It's only with them that I can truly be myself.*    
*Does that make me an introvert? Hmm, maybe...*     
But really, **I'm not afraid of crowds much, and I'm not afraid to speak in front of a large audience**. During my time in college, **public speaking was almost a strength of mine and I'm confident that no one in my class could outdo me in this skill.** Hehe...
